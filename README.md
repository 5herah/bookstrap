Bookstrap
=========

BookStrap is a dashboard that organizes the components of your classes.

I'm currently developing this web app with a small group from my cohort at <a href="http://hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a>, an immersive web development course from which I graduated in February 2013 and continue to work with on a volunteer basis. This particular incarnation of BookStrap has been built for Hack Reactor to use with future students.

For this project, I was responsible for modeling Sprints (units of class time that span two days and contain specific projects, to-do items, feedback sessions, etc). I'm also responsible for the overall UI design.

My current work is to flesh out Sprint management widgets and forms enough to become usable by students in the next cohort. It's a work in progress.
